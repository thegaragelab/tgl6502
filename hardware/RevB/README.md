= TGL-6502 Hardware Revision B

This directory contains the design files for the RevB version of the hardware.
The core processor is still the LPC810 but the IO expander has been replaced
with a [MCP23S08](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=MCP23S08)
8 bit expander and one of the expansion slots has been removed. The firmware will
be updated to reflect the hardware changes, the original firmware remains available
in the 'RevA' branch of the repository and any applicable changes will be merged
across as needed.
